***Django Library Management System***

Project Overview:
I'll create a Library Management System - a perfect beginner-to-intermediate project that covers all essential Django concepts while being practical enough for real-world use.



Problem Statement:

Libraries need an efficient system to manage their book inventory, track book loans, and manage members. Manual systems are error-prone and inefficient. Our web-based solution will allow librarians to:

Catalog books with details

Register members

Track book loans and returns

Send overdue notifications

Generate reports



Why This is a Good Learning Project:

Comprehensive Models: Multiple models with relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)

CRUD Operations: Create books, members, loans; update returns; delete records

Forms: ModelForms for data entry, validation

Admin Customization: Customize Django admin for library staff

Business Logic: Overdue calculations, availability checks

Templates: Reusable templates with inheritance

Authentication: Different views for staff vs. members
